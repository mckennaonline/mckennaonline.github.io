Richard McKenna High School is patterned after the workplace and is a school of choice. Scholars apply to attend Richard McKenna because they have made a conscious commitment to do so and are allowed to remain in our classroom section only so long as they are committed to active participation, as equal partners, in their own education. If a student does not continuously re-earn the privilege of working in our on campus program, that student will be released and may either enroll in our online program or seek his/her education elsewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Our rules and policies are those of any job-site in business or industry. Here, education is our “job.” We come to work each day to build an important product that must last through many years of our collective future -- an educated and skilled spouse, parent, or citizen. This is one of the most important jobs we shall ever have in our life; we take our work seriously and do it with pride.&nbsp;</p></div>

All Richard McKenna Charter School students will be entered in a lottery. Lottery applications will be available in January at rmckenna.org. Completed applications will be turned to Mrs. Bundy by the date stated on the lottery application. Each grade level may have no more than twenty-four students. In the event that less than twenty-four students apply through the lottery process students may submit a transcript and other pertinent records to Mrs. Bundy. After that an observation day is scheduled for the student to determine if Richard McKenna is a good fit for them. Following the observation, the student and at least one parent will have an interview with Director or Head Teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>Richard McKenna High School provides a free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities in a variety of specially designed programs.  Special education and related services are available for persons who qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>Parents, guardians and educators of students attending Richard McKenna High School can refer a student who may be eligible for services and not currently receiving services by contacting the student's teacher, or the school director. The referrals will be given to the special education director for further evaluation.</p></div>

                                <div class="panel-body"><p>Richard McKenna High School has four simple rules built upon industry standards. They are:</p><p>• Show Up</p><p>• Show Up Early</p><p>• Work Hard</p><p>• Be Respectful</p><p><br></p><p>SHOW UP means that we expect our students to be here 100% of the time. We have no excused absences. While we do understand that students sometimes have legitimate reasons for missing work, the fact remains that they are not in attendance and are therefore missing out on their education.</p><p>If a student, for whatever reason, fails to attend at least 90% of the scheduled time, that student will automatically lose the credit for the course that he or she is working on, but may petition the staff for reinstatement of that credit if he or she wishes.</p><p>If a student exhibits a habit of absenteeism, he or she will lose his or her seat in the on campus program until such time as it can be proven that the problem has been successfully overcome.</p><br><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">SHOW UP EARLY means that a student must be early for every class. This allows a student to be physically, mentally, and professionally ready to work when “company time” begins. If a student is even one second late, he or she must sign in at our office, stating the reason for the tardiness, and said student will lose that hour of attendance.</span></p><p><br></p><p>WORK HARD means that a student must remain on task 100% of the time. If a student is found to be wasting valuable time, he or she will be marked off task for the hour.</p><p><br></p><p>BE RESPECTFUL means that any verbal, written, or physical abuse of property or others will result in the student, or students involved being immediately dismissed from the on campus program.</p></div>

We, at Richard McKenna High School, believe so strongly in these behaviors that we devote time at the beginning of each day for our students to do nothing but memorize and review them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Attendance</strong></p><p>1. I show up early every day, prepared for work and dressed appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Completing the Job</strong></p><p>2. I follow all directions closely and produce my best quality work without requiring close supervision.</p><p>3. I work consistently to learn new concepts using my prior knowledge to create connections and greater understanding.</p><p>4. I commit to following through and completing my assigned tasks by their due dates.</p><p>5. I accept responsibility for my errors, learn from them and take action not to repeat them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Time Management on the Job</strong></p><p>6. I plan for success by organizing myself and my work, prioritizing tasks and managing my time effectively.</p><p>7. I identify problems I encounter and take action to find solutions using my logical thinking skills and outside resources.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Communicating on the Job</strong></p><p>8. I listen carefully to others and ask questions to clarify my understanding.</p><p>9. I organize my thoughts in order to communicate them effectively in writing and when speaking.</p><p>10. I carefully review my work for errors, correcting them before submitting it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Collaborating on the Job</strong></p><p>11. I cooperate with my coworkers and perform my share of the workload as a team member.</p><p>12. I maintain a positive attitude toward my work and conduct myself honorably at all times.</p></div>

                                <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Enrollment Options</strong></p><p>If a high school student is dismissed from the on campus program at Richard McKenna High School, they may transfer to the online program.</p><p>These rules are the cornerstone of success, both here at Richard McKenna and in the life that comes after. We wish it to be abundantly clear that we strictly enforce these rules because the product we are working to create is so important that we cannot and will not allow any half measures.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discipline</strong></p><p>In accordance with Idaho, the Richard McKenna Charter School Board of Directors may deny enrollment or may expel or deny attendance to any pupil who is a habitual truant, or who is incorrigible, or whose conduct, in the judgment of the board, is such as to be continuously disruptive of school discipline or the instructional effectiveness of the school, or whose presence in a public school is detrimental to the health and safety of other pupils, or who has been expelled from another school district in this state or any other state. Any pupil having been denied enrollment or expelled may be enrolled or readmitted to the school by the board of directors upon such reasonable conditions as may be prescribed by the board, but such enrollment or readmission shall not prevent the board from again expelling such pupil for cause.</p><p>The board shall expel from school for a period of not less than one (1) year (twelve calendar months) or may deny enrollment to, a student who has been found to have carried a weapon or firearm on school property in Idaho or any other state, except that the board may modify the expulsion or denial of enrollment order on a case-by-case basis. An authorized representative of the board shall report such student and incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency.</p><p>Discipline of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with the requirement of federal law Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Discipline of students with disabilities will consider whether the disability contributed to the student violation of school rules.</p><p>No pupil shall be expelled nor denied enrollment without the board of directors having first given written notice to the parent or guardian of the pupil, which notice shall state the grounds for the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment and the time and place where such parent or guardian may appear to contest the action of the board to deny school enrollment. The notice shall also state the rights of the pupil to be represented by counsel, to produce witnesses and submit evidence on his own behalf, and to cross-examine any adult witnesses who may appear against him. Within a reasonable period of time following such notification, the board of directors shall grant the pupil and his parents or guardian a full and fair hearing on the proposed expulsion or denial of enrollment. However, the board shall allow a reasonable period of time between such notification and the holding of such hearing to allow the pupil and his parents or guardian time to prepare their response to the charge.</p><p>Any pupil who is within the age of compulsory attendance, and who is expelled or denied enrollment as herein provided, shall come under the purview of the Juvenile Corrections Act, and an authorized representative of the board shall, within five (5) days, give written notice of the pupil’s expulsion to the prosecuting attorney of the county of the pupil’s residence.</p><p>The school administrator of any school may temporarily suspend any pupil for disciplinary reasons or for other conduct disruptive of good order or of the instructional effectiveness of school. A temporary suspension by the school administrator shall not exceed five (5) school days in length, and the school administrator may extend the temporary suspension an additional ten (10) school days. Provided, that the board of directors finds that immediate return to school attendance by the temporarily suspended student would be detrimental to other pupils’ health, welfare, or safety, the board may extend the temporary suspension for an additional five (5) school days. Prior to suspending any student, the school administrator shall grant an informal hearing on the reasons for the suspension and the opportunity to challenge those reasons. Any pupil who has been suspended may be readmitted to the school by the school administrator, upon such reasonable conditions as the school administrator may prescribe. The board of directors shall be notified of any temporary suspensions, the reasons therefore, and the response, if any, thereto.</p><p>The board of directors shall establish the procedure to be followed by Richard McKenna Charter School administration for the purpose of affecting a temporary suspension. This procedure must conform to the minimal requirement of due process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Earning Course Credit</strong></p><p>Richard McKenna High School scholars work with teachers within a block schedule. If a scholar has met our attendance requirements, adhered to our rules and policies, successfully completed the course work, and passed all with a 60% or above, he/she will be awarded credit for the course. If not, then said student must repeat that course at a later date.</p><p><br></p><p>If a student fails to pass a course with a mark of 60% or better, he or she will be put on academic probation, if during the next session he or she fails to pass a course with a mark of 60% or better, he or she may not attend the next six-week session in our on campus program, but must sit out and re-apply for attendance in the next session. If a student fails to pass two courses during the same session with a mark of 60% or better, they may not attend the next six-week session in our on campus program.</p><p>As always, a student may enroll in our online program for the time he or she is not enrolled in the on campus program.</p><p><br></p><strong>Cell Phones</strong><br><p>If a student does possess a cell phone, it MUST be turned off and kept out of sight during class time. Some teachers may have a place to store your phone during class time. Phones may be used during daily breaks and at lunch. If a student’s cell phone is being used during class time; the teacher may take the phone and hold unto it until a parent or guardian can pick it up. The privilege of using ones cell phone during breaks and lunch may be removed if inappropriate web browsing is occurring.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Visitors</strong></p>All visitors must sign in and out at our office. This, as with our other rules and policies, is to ensure the safety of our students.<br><p><br></p><strong>Tobacco/Alcohol/Illegal Substance Use</strong><br>IDAHO STATE LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY. Also, the area adjacent to our school is frequently patrolled by officers of the Mountain Home Police Department and students who are smoking illegally will be issued tickets. If a ticket is issued to one of our students, that student must notify his or her parents or guardians, by telephone, from our office immediately following the incident. Parent, or guardians, may also speak with the school’s staff, concerning the violation, if they wish.<div><br></div><div>Any use of tobacco, alcohol and/or illegal substance is prohibited. Any student found abusing these products will be investigated by law enforcement officials and will be suspended or expelled from the school, depending on the circumstances.<br><p><br></p></div><strong>Field Trips</strong><br>Field trips at Richard McKenna High School are considered to be simply an extension of our campus to another location. Consequently, all rules and policies that apply at our home campus also apply during transportation to and from, and while on location at our field trip. The staff will give any special instruction specific to the trip just prior to our departure. When McKenna High School students are on a field trip; all students are required to wear their navy McKenna shirt, and dress code approved tan pants. Any violation of our rules and policies during our field trips may result in the student, or students involved being dismissed from the on campus program. Said students may then transfer to the online program, or may pursue their education elsewhere.<br><br><strong>Computer Use</strong><br>Richard McKenna High School provides computers for student use in certain classes. These computers are to be treated professionally and with care, as are all resources at our school, and used only for projects authorized by the classroom teacher.<div><br></div><div>Misuse of school technology such as visiting unauthorized web sites, plagiarism, personal use or abuse of any kind, may result in the student or students involved losing the privilege of remaining in our on campus program. Your classroom teacher may add instruction and/or restrictions to computer use on a class-by-class basis.&nbsp;</div><br><div><strong>Plagiarism</strong></div><div>Plagiarism, or copying and using information without providing the source, is a form of stealing and is not tolerated. First time violators are placed on probation. Repeated violations will result in suspension from the school.</div></div>

                                <div class="panel-body"><strong>Uniforms</strong><div>In order to prepare our students for success in the world after Richard McKenna High School, we have turned to business, industry, and higher education to help us formulate our rules and policies. Employers have told us that they are having an increasingly difficult time finding employees that will show up consistently to work, show up early, work hard during the time for which they are being paid, and who are respectful to people with whom they come in contact. We have, therefore, developed those four requirements into the basic rules of conduct at our school.</div><div><br></div><div>Employers have also asked that we address the subject of appropriate dress and appearance as an integral part of being professional and respectful in the job place. Our objective in establishing and enforcing our uniform dress code, as with all of our rules and policies, is to enable our students to learn and practice those things that will be expected of them in “the world of work,” to give them an opportunity to reflect their own sense of personal dignity and integrity, and to allow them to represent our school to the public in a positive light.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Shirts and Jackets</strong></div><div>The official Richard McKenna High School uniform shirt must be purchased (at our cost) from our office. Every student must buy at least one navy blue polo shirt with our logo. If students are interested in purchasing more than one shirt, we also have polo shirts available in blue, green, maroon, red, and black. Students may purchase as many shirts as they would like.</div><div>In cold weather conditions, students should consider “layering up” with an undershirt that must not show below their uniform shirt. A long-sleeved shirt may be worn under the uniform shirt.</div><div><br></div><div>If a student wishes to purchase an “official” sweatshirt or hoodie with the Richard McKenna logo embroidered on the front, he or she will need to place an order through the office. If other outerwear is worn; it must be removed by the end of the "Pledge of Allegiance." When this is the case after lunch break, non Richard McKenna outerwear must be removed within the first 10 minutes of class.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Trousers</strong></div><div>RMCHS official trousers or jeans are available at D &amp; B Supply (555 Air Base Road) and are the only pants allowed to be worn as part of the uniform. Store employees will assist you in locating the correct pant. Trousers or jeans that are too tight or too baggy (as determined by the administration of our school), are unacceptable. A conservative belt may be worn with the trousers to keep the waist cinched up to the acceptable height.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Shoes and Footwear</strong></div><div>Loafers, boots, conservative athletic shoes, sneakers, and leather deck shoes are acceptable. Open-toed shoes of any kind are unacceptable. Plain colored stockings/socks should also be worn.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Jewelry, Makeup, Perfume, and Cologne</strong></div><div>Jewelry should be conservative, with no body piercing allowed other than in the ears, and then must be limited to two piercings in each lobe. Gauges are not allowed to be worn. Students with gauge openings will wear clear plugs. Makeup should be used sparingly and should be natural looking. Perfume and cologne is highly discouraged as many persons are allergic and so will be negatively affected even by even a light usage in the workplace.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hats and Head Covering</strong></div><div>Unless worn because of religious mandates, hats and head coverings are not allowed to be worn in Richard McKenna High School. Hoods of the official McKenna hoodie may only be worn outside.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hair</strong></div><div>Hair must always be clean and neat. Any extreme in style and color, or hair that hangs down in one’s face is unacceptable.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Nails</strong></div><div>Fingernails should be trimmed and clean. Extremes in length or color are unacceptable.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div><div>If clothing and grooming fails to meet the standard, as determined by the staff of Richard McKenna High School, the student will be sent home immediately and will be marked absent until the violation is corrected. Continued violation will result in probation or suspension from the on campus program.</div><div><br></div><div>A safe rule of thumb is, if you have a question as to if an item of clothing is acceptable, you probably shouldn’t wear it.</div><div>Once again, this dress code is not arbitrary or punitive; it is taken directly from business and industry policies. We hope that in establishing and enforcing this policy we will help our students to be better prepared to succeed in life after our school. That is our objective in all that we do.</div></div>

                                <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Student Fees and Supplies</strong></p><p>Students enrolled in a course that requires the use of expendable material, such as painting or crafts courses, will be assessed a supply fee, but payment of this fee is not due until the student is actually enrolled in that particular course.</p><p>All students are responsible to furnish the following required supplies:</p><p>• A three-ringed binder (at least two inches wide)</p><p>• Loose-leaf paper</p><p>• A pencil with an eraser (we all make mistakes)</p><p>• A pen that writes either black or blue ink</p><p>• White-out</p><p><br></p><p>Students may have additional supplies if they wish, but ALL students must arrive each day with all of the items on the above list. Students who do not have the supplies on this list will be sent home to get them and will lose attendance hours for their time away.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Personal Items</strong></p><p>Office staff will not be responsible for personal items unless prior arrangements have been made.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lunch Break</strong></p><p>We do not have a hot lunch program at Richard McKenna High School. However, we do have a microwave oven in each classroom. Students are welcome to use these appliances, should they choose to bring lunches to school. Students are not required to stay on campus during the lunch break, but must be back in their seat and ready to resume work at 11:45. If a student does choose to eat lunch in our building, there is always a classroom left open for that purpose. The courtyard is also available for students to use during lunch as long as weather permits. This privilege will remain in place only so long as students conduct themselves maturely and professionally and leave the classroom and courtyard clean and tidy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Parking</strong></p><p>We have ample parking space, but request that staff and students reserve all of the parking in the front (east side) of our building for handicapped parking and for visitors to our school. We also ask that you leave the first four spaces (on either side at the front of our building) empty so that McKenna staff members may park there.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Building Cleanliness</strong></p><p>One of the questions we hear most often from visitors is, “Is your school always this clean and orderly?” We take great pride in being able to respond, “Yes, it is.” The students use the last ten minutes of each day to vacuum, straighten up, and empty wastebaskets. The simple act of cleaning up shows that we respect our school, others, and ourselves, and this in turn enhances the reputation of our school as a place of quality.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phone Calls</strong></p><p>There are no public telephones at Richard McKenna High School. If students wish to make a telephone call, they must do so on a break or during lunch time. The staff will take calls only from students’ parents or guardians, and then FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY (forgetting lunch money is not considered an emergency). Students may not take, or make, phone calls to friends while at school.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Grade Level Pins</strong></p><p>Richard McKenna High School scholars may earn lapel pins after completing the necessary credits at each grade level. Honor pins are rewarded when students complete twelve hours of community service in addition to the required course credits. Students meet with their advisor on the first day of each session to review their academic progress.</p><br><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Daily Class Schedule</strong></span><br></p><p>Richard McKenna High School students enroll in two classes a day for six weeks and receive 90 hours of instruction in each class.</p><p>This schedule allows the student and his or her team to concentrate on two courses at a time and learn skills and concepts embodied in that course in great depth. If a student has met our attendance requirements, adhered to our rules and policies, successfully completed all of the course work, and passed with a grade of 60% or above, he or she will be awarded academic credit for the course. If not, then the scholar must repeat that course at a later date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Daily Schedule</p><p>AM Session 8:00-9:30</p><p>BREAK 9:30-9:45</p><p>AM Session 9:45-11:00</p><p>LUNCH 11:00-11:45</p><p>PM Session 11:45-1:15</p><p>BREAK 1:15-1:30</p><p>PM Session 1:30-3:00</p><p>Dismissal 3:00</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Graduation Requirements</p><p>Earn 46 semester credits in the following areas:</p><p>9 English (one of which must be speech)</p><p>6 Math (two Algebra 1, two Geometry, and two Electives during the senior year)</p><p>6 Science (four of which must be lab sciences)</p><p>5 Social Studies (two U.S. History, two U.S. Government, and one Economics)</p><p>2 Humanities</p><p>1 Health</p><p>17 Electives</p><p>Complete a senior project.</p><p>Take the ACT, SAT or Compass exam by the end of 11th grade.</p><p>Be proficient in Reading, Language, and Math on the 10th grade Spring Idaho Standard Achievement Test (ISAT).</p><p>Residency Clause: Earn at least 6 credits through McKenna High School regardless of the number of credits earned at other schools.</p><p>Transfer Credit: McKenna High School accepts credits transferred from any accredited school or university.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Graduation Ceremony</strong></p><p>We, at Richard McKenna High School, believe the commencement ceremony to be one of the most important rites of passage in American culture. Our scholars have sacrificed twelve years to gain the knowledge, skills, and habits that will allow them to transition to the world of adulthood.</p><p>Our commencement ceremony should be celebrated with formality and dignity by all who have helped our graduates arrive at this point in their lives. It is, therefore, mandatory for all of Richard McKenna High School, staff and students, to attend this occasion. Failure to attend without prior approval may result in disciplinary action.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>School Staff</strong></p><p>Richard McKenna High School is a “staff run” school that is patterned after the workplace. Each staff member is here to help students learn, keep the rules, and develop positive behaviors. Each staff member is also empowered to enforce the rules, at his or her own discretion, should that prove necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Colette Bundy, Registrar-Administrative Assistant</p><p>Jack Dooley, Language Arts</p><p>Jaime Luke, Social Studies</p><p>Todd Thorn, Science</p><p>Anna-Marie Robertson, Math</p><p>Stephanie Hansen, Teacher’s Aid</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

If school is reported as delayed, we will begin classes at 10:00 a.m. Students must call before 10:00 a.m. to check on status of opening.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Building Evacuation</strong></div><div>An evacuation route map is posted next to the door in each room of our building; we require that all of our students and staff familiarize themselves with the proper evacuation route from that room. In the event of an emergency, an alarm will sound. We ask that evacuation be made maturely and professionally. Students must stay with the other members of their class, proceed to the rendezvous area, and wait until roll is taken, further instructions are given, and the student body is formally dismissed.</div><div><br></div><div>We realize that in the event of an actual evacuation, students will be tempted to take out their cell phones to call to inform their loved ones that they are safe. However, for safety reasons, we prohibit the use of cell phones during an evacuation. A staff member has been designated to handle the responsibility of contacting family and loved ones. This is not simply a courtesy, but is enforced to prevent further complication of an already complex situation.</div><div><br></div></div>
