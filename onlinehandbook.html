However, due to the legal contract associated with an IEP, students with disabilities require different enrollment practices. The following steps must be followed in order for a student with an active IEP to enroll in McKenna Online classes.</p><br><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• On the initial enrollment form, if a parent or student specifies that the student has a current IEP, the IEP and the eligibility report must be obtained before the student can enroll in classes. At times, obtaining this paperwork from the previous schools may take several weeks. If the parent or student has a current copy of the IEP and eligibility report, he/she may fax it to the school to speed up this process.</span></p><p><br></p><p>• Once the IEP and eligibility reports are obtained, the special education director will contact the parent for an initial orientation. At that time, the special education director will go over the eligibility report and current IEP to discuss the current goals, objectives, services, and accommodations.</p><p><br></p><p>• There are times when an IEP that is written in a traditional school setting may not be conducive to the online environment. If this is the case, either a formal or informal meeting will be set at which time the IEP may be amended.</p><p><br></p><p>• Once all of the paper work has been completed, the student and parent will have a second orientation with a McKenna Online staff member to go over school policy, the computer system and to choose classes.</p><p><br></p><p>• Please be aware that this process may take several weeks depending upon the timely manner in which the school receives the IEP and eligibility report. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Mrs. Flick, Special Education Director, at (208) 724-1100.</p></div>

<br>Any questions about grades must be taken care of within 2 weeks of course completion. After 2 weeks from the end of the course, grades cannot be changed. (The grades are submitted to the State and the computer locks down the program.)
<br><div><br><strong>Advance Opportunities
</strong><br>Advanced Opportunities allow for students to individualize their high school learning plan to get a jump start on their future. These options include dual credit and technical competency credit.
<br>If you meet RMCHS qualifications, you may be eligible to participate in The Fast Forward Program. The Fast Forward Program can provide funding for students to participate in Advanced Opportunities. Contact your online advisor for more information.<br><div><br></div><div><strong>Dual Credit</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">Richard McKenna Online will grant high school course credit for college courses earned at approved accredited colleges. Richard McKenna Online will grant a one year high school course (two semester credits) for a three credit hour college course. Fewer college credits may be prorated. For example, a student who completes English 101--a one semester course worth three college credit hours--would earn one year's worth of high school English, or two semester credits, whereas a one semester college credit equals only one semester of high school credit.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Testing Policy
</strong></div><div>Richard McKenna Charter Schools require that students must take the state assessment as mandated by Idaho State Department of Education. Richard McKenna students must also take local assessments that measure progress and are mandated by the Idaho Charter School Commission and our Charter. It is required for all students to participate in these tests according to grade level and state specifications. These exams must be proctored. Students will receive notification if they need to test and what specific tests they will need to take. Locations where the tests will be offered will be available when the test
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">window opens or arrangements may be made by Richard McKenna staff depending on where you live. The testing window will open for a short period of time. Students that need to test and do not test will be dropped from their courses and not allowed to complete their current courses resulting in loss of those credits.
</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Special Education
</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Richard McKenna Charter High School provides a free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities in a variety of specially designed programs. Special Education and related services are available for persons who qualify. Parents, guardians and educators of students attending RMCHS can refer a student who may be eligible for services and not currently receiving services by contacting the student's teacher, the school counselor, or the school principal. The referrals will be made to the Special Education Director for further evaluation.
</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Course Extension Policy</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">• Course Extensions may be granted once for one week by a teacher when extenuating circumstances occurr that hinder class work (serious illness, personal injury, death in immediate family, etc. They are NOT granted to students who simply failed to submit their assignments on time and are trying to get caught up). &nbsp;Any extensions beyond that must have administrative approval and can be up to a maximum of three weeks.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">• Extensions cannot be granted for the last session of the year since school will be closed and there will be no course access.</span></div><br><div><strong>Drop Policy</strong><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• Students may drop a course during the first two weeks from the start date without penalty. They will have to start from the beginning if they retake the course.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• Students who drop a course after two weeks from the start date receive an F on their transcript. They will have to start from the beginning if they retake the course.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Missed Assignments</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• Any assignments that are not completed or resubmitted within five days after the due date automatically receive permanent zeros.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Inappropriate, Obscene, or Pornographic Communication</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• If a student uses communication with the teacher and/or students that is determined by the teacher or RMCHS administration to be inappropriate, obscene, or pornographic, the student will be immediately dropped from the
Course. In some cases, legal action may also be taken. Any possibilities for re-admittance must be discussed with the principal, parents and student.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">• If it happens in more than one course, they will be dropped from the school.</span><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></div><div>
Academic honesty is critical to a functioning school and ensuring that all students receive their full education. Academic dishonesty is a violation of the trust between teachers and students and affects the entire school community. Plagiarism or cheating in any form is not tolerated. A student who is found to be academically dishonest will, at the teacher’s discretion, receive a failing grade on the assignment with no opportunity to make it up. In the event of an egregious instance of cheating, the student will receive a failing grade for the entire course at the discretion of the administration. Repeated offenses will result in suspension or expulsion from the school at the discretion of the administration.
</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is the presenting of information, ideas, or language as if it were the student's own work.
Common examples include but are not limited to:
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Copying outside sources into an assignment without acknowledgment, proper attribution or citation. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using the ideas of another person without acknowledgment, proper attribution, or citation.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using outside sources and acknowledging them, but failing to use proper citation techniques such as quotation marks to indicate duplicate wording or identifying which portions are from the outside source and which portions are the student's original work.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Presenting another student's work in part or in full as one's own.
</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Cheating</strong> is any dishonest action to gain an unfair advantage on assignments or projects. Common examples include but are not limited to:
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using a calculator when prohibited.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using an internet search engine to "look up" answers to test or assignment questions the student should be able to answer after engaging with lesson material.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using web services designed to assist student cheating.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Copying answers or projects from another student.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Having another person complete an assignment.
Using notes, textbooks, or outside sources or collaborating with other students when disallowed by the instructor.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Copying and pasting questions, photographing questions, or engaging in other methods of memorializing test questions that can be shared with other students.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Submitting the same work-product for multiple courses without permission of all involved instructors.
</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Acceptable Use
</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It is a violation of school policy and both state and federal laws to access or attempt to access the account of any other user (student, faculty, or staff). It is a violation of school policy to share usernames and passwords with other students. Students found to be sharing their account information or accessing other students' accounts will be expelled from the school and may face legal consequences such as criminal prosecution or civil suit.</span><br></div><br><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>Visit our <a href="hsprivacypolicy.html">online privacy policy</a> page for more info.<br><br><strong>Credit Transfer</strong><br><div>It is up to the student to find out which RMCHS courses will be accepted by their local high school as core credit and which will be accepted as elective credit. RMCHS is accredited by the Northwest Accreditation Commission. Association members are required to accept credits from other members; however, it is the student’s responsibility to get the information from their local school.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">Grading Points (4.0 Scale)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">94 - 100 = A</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">90 - 93 = A-</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">87 - 89 = B+</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">84 - 86 = B</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">80 - 83 = B-</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">77 - 79 = C+</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">74 - 76 = C</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">70 - 73 = C-</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">67 - 69 = D+</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">64 - 66 = D</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">60 - 63 = D-</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;">59--&gt; = F</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></div></div></div>
